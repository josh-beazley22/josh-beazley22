## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am **Joshua Beazley**. I am pursueing a Mechanical Engineering M.S degree at Washington State University. This repository consists of coursework and passion projects throughout my college education.

Let's learn some interesting facts about me:

- ðŸ”­ I am building my own rocket of epic proportions in the Palouse Aerospace club.
- ðŸŒ± A new offshoot in my learning is bio materials. I study the material properties of human implants, load bearing joints, and soft tissue replacement. I am writing a term paper analyzing methods of bioresorbable seuters and capsules for administering medicine. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Send me papers about fluid dynamics of any category, including rocket aerodynamics, turbulance simulation software, and the dispersal patterns of volcanic ash.
- ðŸ¤” Help me make new math puns.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my t-shirt collection.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: josh.beazley22@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am bilingual. I am conversationally fluent in Spanish, the second most spoken language in the world. Sometime in the near future, I hope to hike El Camino de Santiago, a coastal backpacking trail along Spain's northern coast.
